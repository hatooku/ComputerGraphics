Explain how you obtain and use surface normals, and explain how this relates to
the surface smoothness when you are rendering a triangle mesh.

The normals of each vertex are obtained from the OBJ file. Then, the surface normals
are interpolated using the normals of the three vertices of each triangle. This leads
to better surface smoothness compared to simply interpolating based on vertex colors.
