Compare projection shadows to shadow mapping by listing advantages and
disadvantages of the two techniques. 

The shadow mapping method provides more accurate shadows, since it can handle
self-shadowing and better models the physics behind shadows. On the other
hand, projection shadows are not as accurate since we project the objects onto
one plane, while the shadows may exist in many different places (such as the
object itself).

However, projection shadows do have their advantages. For one, it is much
simpler to implement than shadow mapping. In addition, it is faster, since
shadow mapping requires the generation of a shadow map, which means that we
need to render twice for every render() call, although the first render from
the light's point of view is less computationally expensive. Thus, when speed
is a concern, projection shadows may be the only choice available.
