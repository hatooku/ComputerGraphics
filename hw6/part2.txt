When using the "Nearest" texture filtering mode, we see many visible aliasing errors along the lines of the checkerboard. When we use the "Linear" mode, we see that the lines become much smoother and higher resolution. The "Mipmap" (Linear-Linear) mode further improves the minification filter by smoothing out parts of the checkerboard that are farther from the camera. These parts appear more "blurry" and smoother rather than having aliasing errors.
